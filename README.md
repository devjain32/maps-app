Maps App by Dev Jain

The initial version of my app was made using an SVG as my base map. However, after having an opportunity to see maps that the team uses, I decided to switch to using Leaflet with GeoJSON to populate the counties on the map.

The updated Leaflet map allows users to zoom into the map and see cities, highways, and other details to better determine which counties to select. The app allows users to create (and delete) regions and add (and delete) counties within them. To see the counties that have not yet been added to any region, users can go to the "Unselected" tab. From this tab, users can search and select counties and add them to a region directly.

In any region tab, users can click on a county in that region and see what other regions also contain the county and which ones don't. From here, users can directly delete duplicates or add that county to other regions.

For easy visibility, users can change the fill color of each region on the map.
